        <h3>Welcome to RateMyPath</h3>
        <p>Transform your campus experience like never before with RateMyPath, a platform designed to assist the disabled 
            community in navigating the University of Maryland, College Park. Our mission is to ensure that every student 
            is provided with the necessary knowledge to explore pathways that promote reliability and inclusion. </p>
        <p>Navigating a campus as large as ours is an obstacle in itself, but the recent influx of construction has only compounded
             this challenge. Many disabled students describe getting around campus as anxiety-inducing, wishing that accessibility
              was more of a default response rather than an afterthought. We built RateMyPath to address this crucial need, 
              foster community engagement around the urgency of inclusion, and serve as a supportive network. </p>
        <p>By offering UMD a community-driven resource in which students can review and rate their path experiences based on 
            accessibility and disability-friendliness, we strive to create a hub of shared feedback where students can utilize 
            their peers' insights to move more confidently and freely around campus.</p>
