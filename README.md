# Rate MyPath offers a community-driven resource in which students can find accessible navigation directions around UMD.

# Website Development: Utilized HTML for our foundational structure, CSS for our styling and layout, JavaScript for our animations, and  Visual Studio (VS) as a suite for coding collaboration.

# Project Goals:
# When discussing the problems we face as university students, we suddenly realized how many issues are often dismissed when it comes to marginalized groups. 
# A specific challenge that came up was how the influx of construction at UMD obstructs pathways around campus. 
# We recognized how much of a challenge this presents to disabled students and decided to build a website that could address this, and even serve as a supportive network in the long run.
